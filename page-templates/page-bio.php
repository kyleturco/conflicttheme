            I understand how challenging difficult life situations can be and the importance of
            handling them in a manner that will achieve the best possible outcome for all involved. A strong education
            combined with personal experience in a wide range of conflict gives me both knowledge and perspective for
            satisfying mediation, conflict management, and communication resolution.

          My passion for studying and learning communication and conflict management was born
          from a desire to be the best parent, best wife, and best friend and that I could.
          I recognize that our communication, our ability to get what we want and give what
          we can, is limited by what we have learned, or how we have decided that the process
          should go.   There are other ways, often better ways, that we just havenâ€™t learned.
          Communication and relationships are more delicate and more complicated than we expect.  However, with help and guidance, it is possible to achieve mutual understanding, learn better communication skills, and reach decisions that produce the best outcomes possible.  Conflict is normal and necessary.  So are emotions.  They are opportunity for understanding, growth, and ultimately deeper, more satisfying relationships.

          My personal life experiences include raising 5 wonderful children.  I have
          experienced  the  formidable challenges of divorce.  I have decades of work
          with individuals and families in crisis.   As a Certified Emergency registered
          nurse, I have dealt with healthcare conflict on all levels.  I have navigated
          family members, including my own, through eldercare decisions which involved
          mediations with eldercare facilities.   I understand how important handling
          difficult life events can be and I appreciate the importance of handling them
          as well as possible, for all involved.   A strong education combined with personal
          experience in a wide range of conflict gives me both knowledge and perspective
          for satisfying mediation, conflict management, and communication resolution.
